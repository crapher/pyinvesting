## Quick Start

The search module is used to search all the information related to a specific ticker.

The information that can be retrieved is:
- Tickers: It will be used by the rest of the modules to get online or historical data
- News: They are all the news related to a specific search.
- Articles: They are all the articles related to a specific search.
